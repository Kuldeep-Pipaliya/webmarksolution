          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah noticed a major shift in the way people shop and purchase products. Buyers didnâ€™t want to be interrupted by ads, they wanted helpful information. In 2006, they founded HubSpot to help companies use that shift to grow better with inbound marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the way, HubSpot expanded beyond marketing into a crafted, not cobbled suite of products that create the frictionless customer experience that buyers expect today. Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, HubSpot uses its customer platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help millions of scaling organizations grow better.
